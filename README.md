# ytube_videos_analysis
This projects deal with the youtube videos analysis in Indian region to analyze the data of most viewed videos on geopolitics, whether the channel to which video belongs deals solely in geopolitics, video categories, correlation between subscribers, likes and comment if any.


In this project I've tried to analyze the data fetched from YouTube API. The fetch criteria is top 10 most viewed videos on Geoplotics in India, based on that channel data is extracted and then the top 10 videos of each channel.

Limitation :
Query the data based on keyword "Geopolitics|geopolitics" only.

Analysis done to find out :

-- Comparison between the number of subscribers and view count of top 10 videos of each channel
-- Categories on which these videos are made and their %.
-- Average videos release by channels each year since the channel is published.
-- Distribution of Likes,Comments and views count of all the videos
-- Correlation between views and likes or likes and comments
-- Word Map of video description
